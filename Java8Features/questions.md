Here are 10 questions each for simple, medium, and hard categories to practice your Java 8 skills:

Simple (1-10):
--------------
1. Filter a list of numbers and keep only even numbers. (Use filter)
2. Convert a list of strings to uppercase. (Use map)
3. Sum all the elements in a list of integers. (Use sum)
4. Check if a string is a palindrome. (Use reverse and equals)
5. Find the first element in a list that is greater than 10. (Use findFirst)
6. Sort a list of objects by a specific property. (Use sorted and Comparator)
7. Create a map from a list of key-value pairs. (Use Collectors.toMap)
8. Group a list of objects by a specific property. (Use Collectors.groupingBy)
9. Count the occurrences of each element in a list. (Use Collectors.counting)
10. Print the first 5 elements of a stream. (Use limit)

Medium (11-20):
---------------
11. Remove all duplicates from a list. (Use distinct or a Set)
12. Flatter a list of lists into a single list. (Use flatMap)
13. Write a custom filter function to filter strings by length. (Use lambda expressions)
14. Calculate the average of squares of all elements in a list. (Use map, mapToInt, and average)
15. Group a list of products by category and then find the product with the highest price in each category. (Use Collectors.groupingBy and maxBy)
16. Write a method that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the unique strings. (Use stream and collect with a Set)
17. Write a program to reverse a sentence using streams. (Use map and reduce)
18. Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. (Optional: Implement a functional approach using streams)
19. Write a program to validate an email address using regular expressions. (Use matches with a regular expression pattern)
20. Create a custom consumer to print the even numbers in a stream. (Use lambda expressions)

Hard (21-30):
-------------
21. Implement a simple calculator using Java 8 features like streams and lambdas.
22. Write a program to find the longest palindrome in a list of strings. (Use streams and potentially recursion)
23. Implement a custom function interface for performing mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) and use it with lambda expressions.
24. Parallelize a stream to process a large list of elements concurrently. (Use parallelStream)
25. Write a program to implement a basic dictionary using a HashMap and streams for searching and manipulation.
26. Create a custom Optional class with methods like ifPresent and orElse similar to the built-in Optional class.
27. Write a program to implement a custom Stream interface that can handle custom data sources like iterators.
28. Implement a custom Consumer that can perform conditional logic based on the element it consumes.
29. Write a program to convert a stream of objects into a different type of object using functional programming techniques. (Use map)
30. Implement a caching mechanism using the Supplier interface to memoize the result of a slow-running function.
These questions cover various aspects of Java 8 features like Streams, Lambdas, Functional Interfaces, Optionals, and more. 

By practicing these, you can improve your understanding and problem-solving skills with Java 8.
